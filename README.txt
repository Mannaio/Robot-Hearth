A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/Mannaio/pen/wKVGoQ.

 I got the idea from Robert Dabi's Dribbble, you can get the link in the pen. 

Decided to make it out of CSS and HTML, and added in a spinning bowtie and a flashing light, which you can only see in Firefox right now because it's dependent on pseudo element animations. 

Forked from [Albert Filice](http://codepen.io/monstersaurous/)'s Pen [CSS Robot w/ Spinning Bow Tie](http://codepen.io/monstersaurous/pen/oDtuI/).
